Number of Instances: 392

The complete structure of this dataset is:

1. mpg:           continuous (numeric)
2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete (integer)
3. displacement:  continuous (numeric)
4. horsepower:    continuous (integer)
5. weight:        continuous (integer)
6. acceleration:  continuous (numeric)
7. model year:    multi-valued discrete (integer)
8. origin:        multi-valued discrete (integer)
9. car name:      string (unique for each instance) (factor)
